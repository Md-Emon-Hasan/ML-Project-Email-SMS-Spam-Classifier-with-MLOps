## üìñ Introduction

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on classifying emails as spam or non-spam using supervised learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and deployment aspects of the project.

---

## üéØ Why This Project

The primary motivation behind creating this project is to tackle the issue of email spam, which remains a significant problem affecting users' productivity and security. By accurately classifying emails, this project aims to improve email filtering systems.

---

## üìä Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains a collection of emails labeled as spam or ham. It includes various features extracted from the emails, such as text content, subject line, sender information, etc.

---

## üåü Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and transformed dataset for machine learning model compatibility.
- **Model Development:** Trained multiple machine learning models to classify emails as spam or ham.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated models using appropriate metrics to ensure accuracy and reliability.
- **Deployment:** Implemented a simple web-based or command-line application for classifying new emails.

---

## üß† Models Implemented

Several machine learning models were implemented and evaluated:

- Naive Bayes Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest Classifier
- Logistic Regression
- others

Each model's performance was compared based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

---

## üìä Evaluation Metrics

The models were evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy:** Overall correctness of the predictions.
- **Precision:** Proportion of true positives among all positive predictions.
- **Recall:** Proportion of true positives identified correctly.
- **F1-score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics.
